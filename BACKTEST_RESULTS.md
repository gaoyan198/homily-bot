# Backtest results — strategy vs S&P 500 / Nasdaq-100

**Re-run in full 2026-07-10 (D-63 session).** Windows roll with the run
date, so bars shift a few days vs the 2026-07-08 figures; deltas ≤0.4 pt.
**$1/month contributions** · **10 bps per trade** · **point-in-time**
(signals computed only from bars up to each decision day — no look-ahead).

Reproduce: `python homily_strategy_backtest.py` (5y THE test) ·
`python homily_bear_backtest.py` (D-63 bear decomposition, Steps 1+2) ·
`python homily_multiwindow_backtest.py` (every ≥5y window since 2015).
Every number is raw output — nothing is hand-entered.

> ### ⚠ Data-integrity note (2026-07-10)
> Yahoo's chart API **silently returns monthly bars for `range=max`** while
> honouring daily granularity for `5y`/`10y`. Every previous "max-range"
> replay (the D-63 Step-2 grinding-bear run of 2026-07-08, which also
> crashed before printing) was computing daily signals on monthly bars —
> garbage. `homily_data.py` now requests epoch `period1/period2` for full
> history and **refuses any non-daily response** (validate test [22]).
> All 5y/10y numbers were unaffected (verified by regression); every
> max-range number below is from the fixed fetch.

> ### ⚠ Correction (kept from the 2026-07-08 revision)
> An earlier version let no-⭐ months sit in cash instead of buying the
> index per PLAYBOOK §3.5. The idx-fallback rows below are the faithful
> strategy; the old cash-wait variant flattered the 5y number.

## 1 · THE test (committed protocol): 5y and 10y, honest control

Universe B = "hype-2021 control": winners AND wrecks a growth investor
plausibly held in mid-2021 (PTON ZM DOCU ROKU LCID…). Names fetched at
window length, so a name needs a year of in-window bars before it can be
bought (see §3 for the cleaner full-history protocol — it lowers the 5y
result).

### 5-year window (2021-07 → 2026-07)

| Scenario | MOIC | CAGR | MaxDD |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| DCA S&P 500 (SPY) | 1.51 | 11.3% | −23% |
| DCA Nasdaq-100 (QQQ) | 1.77 | 14.7% | −34% |
| **Strategy — honest control, idx-fallback** | **1.77** | **16.7%** | −26% |
| Strategy — honest control, + bear-sell overlay (mode b) | 1.27 | 6.8% | −28% |
| Hindsight univ (discount entirely), idx-fallback | 2.67 | 29.9% | −23% |

### 10-year window (2016-07 → 2026-07)

| Scenario | MOIC | CAGR | MaxDD |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| DCA S&P 500 (SPY) | 2.09 | 13.1% | −24% |
| **DCA Nasdaq-100 (QQQ)** | **2.92** | **20.1%** | −34% |
| Strategy — honest control, idx-fallback = SPY | 2.07 | 16.4% | −67% |
| Strategy — honest control, + bear-sell overlay (mode b) | 1.35 | 9.5% | −64% |
| Strategy — honest control, §5.2 per-name exit (mode f) | 2.54 | 19.8% | −65% |

**Read:** 5y — beat both indexes modestly (but see §3: the cleaner
protocol erases the QQQ win). 10y — beats SPY on CAGR, **loses to QQQ**
(2.07–2.54 vs 2.92 MOIC) at roughly **double the drawdown**. The best
strategy arm over 10y is the **per-name §5.2 exit**, not any market-timing.

---

## 2 · D-63 — the 🐻 sell step decomposed (the bear-regime verdict)

The committed "bear-sell overlay" (rows above) sells *everything*, every
bear month, into cash, and lump re-enters. PLAYBOOK §4 never said that.
The decomposition isolates each decision (`homily_bear_backtest.py`;
modes: a hold-through · b the tested overlay · c freeze-only, no sells,
contributions→index · d faithful §4: sell once at onset→dry powder,
contributions→index, re-enter in thirds · e sell satellites into index at
onset · f no market selling, §5.2 per-name exit only).

### Step 1 — honest control, windows containing only the 2022 (V-shaped) bear

| mode | 5y MOIC | 5y CAGR | 5y MaxDD | 10y MOIC | 10y CAGR | 10y MaxDD |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| (a) hold-through | 1.77 | 16.7% | −26% | 2.07 | 16.4% | −67% |
| (b) sell-all + cash | 1.27 | 6.8% | −28% | 1.35 | 9.5% | −64% |
| (c) freeze-only | 1.69 | 15.0% | −23% | 2.05 | 16.2% | −65% |
| (d) faithful §4 | 1.37 | 9.9% | −23% | 1.60 | 11.3% | −43% |
| (e) sell-into-index | 1.70 | 15.2% | −23% | 2.27 | 16.0% | −27% |
| (f) §5.2 per-name only | 1.79 | 16.7% | −25% | 2.54 | 19.8% | −65% |

2022 episode in isolation: every de-risking mode (c/d/e) held 0.92 vs
hold-through's 0.88 — **the overlay's V-bear cost lives in the recovery
months**, when hold-through was still averaging into crushed names and the
protocol was re-entering in thirds.

### Step 2 — grinding bears (the design case): 1993→2026, dot-com + 2008 + 2022

High-beta survivors (AMZN NVDA AAPL MSFT ADBE INTC CSCO QCOM ORCL EBAY) —
**survivor-biased, which flatters hold-through**, since the names that
died in 2000–02 aren't fetchable.

| mode | MOIC | CAGR | MaxDD |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| DCA SPY | 5.87 | 8.8% | −54% |
| DCA QQQ (from 1999-03) | 10.66 | 10.0% | −80% |
| (a) hold-through | 73.45 | 21.3% | **−76%** |
| (b) sell-all + cash | 59.13 | 21.1% | −36% |
| (c) freeze-only | 53.83 | 20.1% | −76% |
| **(d) faithful §4** | **50.00** | **20.4%** | **−29%** |
| (e) sell-into-index | 13.58 | 15.2% | −64% |
| (f) §5.2 per-name only | 47.83 | 19.5% | −79% |

### D-63 verdict (per the pre-committed decision rule)

* **The sell step is real tail insurance, priced.** Through two grinding
  bears + one V-bear, faithful §4 gave up ~**1 pt/yr** (and ~⅓ of final
  wealth) vs never-selling to cut the worst drawdown from **−76% to −29%**.
  In the V-shaped 2022 window alone the premium was ~7 pts/yr. It is kept,
  reframed as insurance — PLAYBOOK §4 now quotes these numbers.
* **The overlay the earlier tables maligned was never the playbook** —
  selling monthly into cash + lump re-entry (b) is strictly worse than
  once-at-onset + index-contributions + thirds re-entry (d) in grinders
  (−36% vs −29% MaxDD) and similar in the V-window. Correction recorded.
* **Freeze-only (c) — pause adds but don't sell — is the worst of both
  worlds:** kept the entire −76% grinder drawdown AND still lagged
  hold-through in the V-window. It is not a middle way; PLAYBOOK §4 now
  says so.
* **Sell-into-index (e) is catastrophic in grinders** (15.2% vs 20.4%):
  it locks in the satellite loss at onset and never participates in the
  recovery. Dead idea.
* **The per-name §5.2 exit (f) is the only mode that ADDED return on the
  honest control** (+3.4 pts/yr over hold at 10y) — it takes out the
  PTON/ZM class. But it provides **zero crash insurance** (−79% in
  grinders). §4 = insurance; §5.2 = trash-taker. Different jobs, both kept.
  *(Caveat: (f) was tested without its F-gate — an aggressive upper bound.)*

## 3 · Multi-window re-test — the owner's bar (2026-07-10)

*"If the strategy cannot clear the S&P 500 or the Nasdaq over multiple
≥5-year periods, our efforts are not worth it."*
(`homily_multiwindow_backtest.py`: 7 rolling 5y windows + 2 ten-year
windows, full-history bars — names are eligible the day a window opens,
the cleaner protocol.)

**A curated list is only out-of-sample AFTER its construction date.** The
"honest" control was assembled as *what a growth investor held in
mid-2021* — so pre-2021 windows on it are as hindsight-flattered as the
current universe is for 2026 (they print 54–84% CAGR; ignore them). The
windows that mean something:

| window (univ B) | DCA SPY | DCA QQQ | strategy (a) | per-name (f) | honest? | verdict |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|---|
| 2017→2022 | 1.20 | 1.31 | 1.04 | 1.44 | straddles 2021 | (a) loses to both |
| 2018→2023 | 1.29 | 1.49 | 0.98 | 1.21 | straddles | loses to both |
| 2019→2024 | 1.41 | 1.62 | 1.10 | 1.26 | straddles | loses to both |
| 2020→2025 | 1.40 | 1.53 | 1.71 | 1.68 | straddles | beats both |
| **2021→2026** | **1.50** | **1.78** | **1.70** | **1.69–1.78** | **fully honest** | **beats SPY, ties-to-loses QQQ** |
| 2016→2026 (10y) | 2.09 | 2.96 | 2.76 | 3.36–3.83 | straddles | (a) loses QQQ; (f) beats |

(MOIC, money-weighted — the saver's number. Strategy MaxDD in these
windows: −59…−76% vs index −23/−34%. The current universe A sweeps all 9
windows vs both indexes — that is the hindsight upper bound, not
evidence.)

**Protocol honesty:** under this cleaner eligibility protocol the
committed "5y win over QQQ" (1.77 vs 1.77 at 16.7% CAGR) **degrades to
1.70 vs 1.78 — a small loss** — because the committed run force-parked the
first year in the index while names accrued bars, accidentally dodging
part of the 2022 drawdown.

**Why the straddling windows lose:** the ⭐ gate (monthly-up + weekly-RED
+ chip support) kept qualifying ZM/PTON-class names through 2020–21 as
they became eligible — momentum entries into a bubble. The gate does not
dodge regime-scale overvaluation; nothing in the system currently does.

---

## 4 · Selection inside the ⭐ set (#24, run 2026-07-10) — the first gate to PASS toward the bar

Owner directive: north star stays *beat QQQ*; the lever is selection.
`homily_selection_backtest.py` replays the same monthly candidate sets and
varies only the pick: equal-split-all (current behaviour) · alphabetical
top-5 (what PLAYBOOK §3.4's "max 5" accidentally does) · top-5/3 by 12m
relative strength · top-5/3 by conviction score · 200 seeded random-5
draws (the luck benchmark). Decision rule pre-registered in the file
docstring before the first run.

Universe B, the three construction-honest read windows (MOIC):

| window | DCA QQQ | equal-all | random-5 p10–p90 | rs12-top3 | conv-top3 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 2020→2025 | 1.53 | 1.71 | 1.66–1.77 | **1.89** | 1.83 |
| **2021→2026 (fully honest)** | **1.78** | 1.70 | 1.66–1.75 | **1.82 ✓** | 1.73 |
| 2016→2026 (10y straddle) | 2.96 | 2.76 | 2.73–2.78 | 2.84 | 2.87 |

**Verdict (mechanical):** `rs12-top3` passed all four pre-registered
checks (beats equal 3/3, beats random-median 3/3 — in fact above the p90
of 200 random draws in all three — drawdown held, beats alpha-top5 3/3);
`conv-top3` also passed (2/3 on alpha). **rs12-top3 is the promotion
candidate** — declared now to prevent best-of-N shopping later; the
conviction score ranked no better than raw relative strength (a partial
#20 answer: its weight is carried by the trend/RS components).

**Honesty box:** the lift is modest (+0.04…+0.18 MOIC over 5–10y); the
read sample is 3 windows; the 10y straddle still loses to QQQ (2.84 vs
2.96); and on hindsight universe A's 2017/2018/2019-start windows the same
rule *underperformed* equal-all (concentrated momentum whipsaws in
reversals — 2019→2024 A: 2.35 vs 2.59, below random's p10). This is a real
but narrow edge in trending tapes, not a solved problem. The fully-honest
window's QQQ cross (1.82 vs 1.78) is one window, ~2 points of MOIC.

**Status:** gate PASSED, promotion **deferred to ≥2026-10-01** — R10
allows one promoted signal-behaviour change per quarter and the 🐳
WHALE-DIP tier used 2026-Q3's slot (2026-07-06). Until then the live
ledger (#13) accrues fresh out-of-sample rows: before promotion, check
that ⭐ names ranked top-3-by-RS12 in the ledger actually outperformed the
rest — a free forward test the promotion must also survive.

---

## 5 · #18 total-return correctness — the RS12 delta (run 2026-07-10)

RS12 (and RS6) now measure **total** return — dividends reinvested, on both
the name and the SPY benchmark — instead of raw price return. Raw OHLC still
drives every chip level, POC, $-volume and the G4 basis test: a printed level
has to be a price you could have traded at (EXECUTION R1).

Reproduce: `python homily_conviction.py --rs-delta [SYM…]`.

The PRD's premise (#18: "payers V MA COST LLY NVO are systematically docked")
is **only half right**, and the direction was published before it was measured:

| effect | pts on RS12 |
|---|---|
| SPY's own 12m yield, now credited to the benchmark | **−1.3** to every name |
| the name's own 12m yield, now credited back to it | +0 … +8.9 (D05.SI) |

So the delta is `name_yield − spy_yield`, not `name_yield`. A **sub-SPY-yield**
payer still loses ground: V −0.6, MA −0.6, COST −0.8, LLY −0.2. Only real
yielders gain: **D05.SI +7.6**, JNJ +2.8, NVO +2.1, KO +2.0. Zero-dividend
growth names all sit on the −1.3 floor. `CSPX.L` (accumulating ETF — dividends
are inside the NAV, never distributed) correctly takes the full −1.3.

**Across all 68 universe names, G3 flipped for none of them.** Range −1.3 …
+7.6 pts, and the gate sits at +20. The closest call is NET (+21.9 → +20.5,
still passing). This is a **correctness fix with no measured selection effect
today** — it removes a bias that would have mattered had the universe held
high-yield names, and it is the honest denominator for every future RS number.
It is not alpha, and it does not move the bar in the bottom line below.

**Footnote for §1–§4 above:** those tables were produced with **raw-close**
RS12, and are NOT regenerated. The backtests (`homily_selection_backtest.py`,
`homily_strategy_backtest.py`, `homily_core4_backtest.py`) still rank on raw
closes, so live RS12 and backtested RS12 now differ by the yield spread above.
For the momentum-growth universe those tables screen, the spread is a near
-constant −1.3 pts across names — a rank-preserving shift, which is why the
#24 `rs12-top3` gate result stands unchanged. Migrating the backtests to
`fetch_series()` is queued as **#64** (PRD §8.5); until it lands, do not
compare a live RS12 print against a number in §1–§4 to the tenth of a point.

## 6 · #39 bootstrap CIs on THE test (run 2026-07-11)

Circular block bootstrap (block 6 ≈ a regime half-year, 10,000 resamples,
seed 39) over each arm's 60 monthly NAV returns from the 5y THE-test window
(2021-07 → 2026-07, idx-fallback+regime arm, the faithful strategy).
P(>QQQ DCA) uses PAIRED draws — the same blocks applied to both series —
so the arms' correlation is preserved. Reproduce: `python homily_bootstrap.py`.

| arm | realized MOIC | p5 | p25 | p50 | p75 | p95 | P(>QQQ DCA) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DCA SPY (benchmark) | 1.52 | 0.99 | 1.21 | 1.36 | 1.52 | 1.76 | — |
| DCA QQQ (benchmark) | 1.77 | 0.92 | 1.23 | 1.49 | 1.77 | 2.26 | — |
| strategy A current univ (HINDSIGHT) | 1.65 | 0.96 | 1.24 | 1.48 | 1.79 | 2.36 | 53.5% |
| strategy B hype-2021 control | 1.29 | 0.79 | 1.01 | 1.21 | 1.46 | 1.91 | **23.8%** |

Reading: the one-window numbers §1 committed are points inside WIDE bands —
QQQ DCA's own 5–95 band spans 0.92–2.26×. On the honest universe the
strategy beats QQQ DCA in only ~24% of resampled paths; even the
hindsight-picked universe is a coin flip (53.5%). This does not change the
bottom-line verdict below — it quantifies how little one 5y window can
prove in either direction, which is exactly why #14's live scorecard (and
#71's pre-registered noise band, which reuses this machinery) referees all
future promotions. CAVEAT (mandatory, D-39): bootstrap cannot manufacture
unseen regimes — these are within-window uncertainty bands, not forecasts.

## 7 · #82 ribbon run-length (run 2026-07-11)

How long does a weekly-RED spell last once it opens? Max-history weekly
closes, live circle engine on prefixes, both universes; completed spells
only (29 open spells excluded as right-censored). Reproduce:
`python homily_ribbon_backtest.py`.

| universe | n spells | median | p25 | p75 | p90 | mean |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A current | 1,110 | 9w | 2w | 24w | 44w | 17.0w |
| B hype-2021 | 329 | 7w | 2w | 22w | 36w | 14.8w |
| **combined** | **1,439** | **8w** | 2w | 23w | 42w | 16.5w |

Entry-candle conditioning ("big red candles open runs lasting weeks to
months") did NOT clear its pre-committed rule (big-entry median must beat
small-entry by ≥3w on BOTH universes: A +3w, B −1w) — the unconditional
base rate ships alone. Shipped: RED rows print `med run 8w`
(`RED_MEDIAN_RUN_W`, info-only, gates nothing). Danny's qualitative claim
is directionally supported — a quarter of runs last 23w+ — but entry-candle
size is not the tell he implies, at least not at our weekly-circle
approximation.

---

## 8 · #78 pullback clock (run 2026-07-11)

Dip = maximal run of non-RED daily candles inside an intact weekly-RED
spell; resolved by a RED candle (weekly still RED), failed if the weekly
circle breaks mid-run. 5y daily, live engines on prefixes. Reproduce:
`python homily_pullback_backtest.py`.

| cut | n | median | p25 | p75 | p90 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| A all / H1 / H2 | 1082 / 361 / 721 | 5d / 6d / 4d | 1d | 13–14d | 21d |
| B all / H1 / H2 | 512 / 128 / 384 | 4d / 5d / 4d | 1d | 14–16d | 21–23d |
| **combined resolved** | **1,594** | **4d** | 1d | 14d | 22d |
| failures (weekly broke mid-dip) | 483 | 3d | 1d | 10d | 17d |

STABLE per the pre-committed rule (medians within ±1d, p90 within ±2d
across A/B × H1/H2) → the info-only digest counter shipped: weekly-RED
rows with a non-RED candle print `dip d{n} (med 4d · p90 22d)`. Danny's
"3–7 trading days" holds at the median, not the spread. NOT shipped: the
past-p90 trend-failure warning the PRD floated — failures resolve FASTER
(median 3d), so the resolved:failed ratio at long ages ≈ the base rate and
dip age alone carries no escalation signal. That null is recorded here so
nobody re-derives the idea.

---

## 9 · #77 multi-timeframe volatility hole (run 2026-07-11) — NULL, closed

Weekly/monthly resamples fed to the frozen daily `find_hole` engine; event
walker identical to the committed daily study. This consumed 2026-Q3's one
timing-modifier research slot (R10 / PRD §8.1 — #74 and #81 wait for later
quarters). Reproduce: `python homily_mtf_vol_backtest.py`.

**1 · SPY-monthly replication (Danny's Apr-2026 "perfect record since Dec
2013" claim): does NOT replicate as an edge.** At ref 24mo: 5 resolved
breakouts, all positive fwd6m (+2.2…+10.2%, mean +5.1%), 4/5 positive
fwd12m (mean +7.9%). But SPY's UNCONDITIONAL forward returns over the same
period are +6.0% fwd6m (78% positive) and +12.3% fwd12m (83% positive) —
the breakouts ran at or BELOW the market's base rate. The "perfect record"
is the equity drift, not the indicator; and n=5 in 12 years could not
support a rule even if the mean were above baseline. (Engine-default
ref 60: 4 events, same picture.)

**2 · Weekly-VH event study (58 names, 5y): NULL.** A: breakout fwd4w
+5.5% vs baseline +4.2% but fwd12w 12.2% vs 13.1% (below); B: below
baseline at both horizons (+1.2% vs +2.1% / +4.7% vs +6.0%); ALL: +3.5% vs
+3.2% / 8.1% vs 9.6%. The daily study's modest breakout edge (+4.4 vs
+2.8 / +11.5 vs +8.5) does NOT survive the move to weekly bars.

**3 · Sequence claim (daily fires first, weekly confirms): directionally
present, not usable.** Weekly breakouts preceded by a daily-VH breakout
within 56 days did better than those without (fwd4w +3.6% vs +2.9%, fwd12w
+8.8% vs +5.5%) — but neither leg beats the all-weeks baseline, so there
is nothing to gate money on.

Verdict: the DAILY hole keeps its place (🔵 upgrade + score component);
weekly/monthly confirmation adds nothing measurable in our universes and
ships nowhere. Closed per Part III rule 6.

## Bottom line — measured against the owner's bar

**The strategy engine, as an index-beating machine, does not clear the
bar.** On construction-honest evidence it beats the S&P 500 more often
than not, but it does **not** reliably beat QQQ over ≥5y windows — the
fully honest window loses to QQQ slightly, the 2021-straddling windows
lose to both, and every strategy arm carries **2–3× the index drawdown**
(−59…−76% vs −34%). "DCA into QQQ and never look" remains the strongest
simple competitor, exactly as the 2026-07-08 revision concluded — and the
cleaner protocol strengthens that conclusion.

**The live path toward the bar (owner's standing directive: don't
concede):** §4's rs12-top3 concentration is the first gated, pre-registered
change that moved the honest window past QQQ (1.82 vs 1.78) — promotion
queued for 2026-Q4 behind a ledger forward-check. The remaining levers, in
expected order of impact: the universe itself (#65 — a screen can't buy a
winner it never sees), the ⚪ time-stop calibration (#51, sharpening the
one return-adding exit), and the re-pointed refine loop (#21). One gated
change at a time; the scorecard (#14) referees.

**What the system measurably IS good for:**
1. **The per-name §5.2 exit added ~3 pts/yr on the wreck-salted control**
   — the one arm with a repeatable, attributable edge (getting out of
   broken businesses). Worth calibrating properly (#51) and promoting only
   through its gate.
2. **The 🐻 protocol is honestly-priced tail insurance** — ~1 pt/yr over
   33 years to turn −76% into −29%. That is a *behavioural* product: it
   exists so the human survives the grinder without capitulating.
3. **Discipline infrastructure** — the ledger, alerts, buy-day copilot and
   honesty gates change the savings rate and the behaviour gap (#58),
   which PLAYBOOK §8 already ranks above any signal.

Anything claiming more than that is not supported by our own numbers.
